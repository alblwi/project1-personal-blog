                        These questions got augmented with more questions. Like<u>"what if the computer is remote?"</u> -> "You need to understand networking." That's why I got my <i>CCNA</i>. I didn't have any great love for configuring network devices.
                        I wanted to understand networks well enough to exploit remote systems.

                        Now, along the way, I found out that programming allowed me to create all sorts of handy little pieces of code to do various tasks automatically. This began to appeal to me as much as hacking. So, I started leaning more towards building software and less
                        towards breaking software. That said, I still have a love for security and hacking. I'm surprised (though I probably shouldn't be) at how little most developers know of security and secure coding practices.

                        As to your varied list of sub-domains to pursue, you have to decide what your motivations are. Are you interested in having a large user-base? Well, then mobile development is where it's at right now. Websites/web apps would be next. That's where your
                        "full stack" pursuit would come in. Big data is also very popular right now, but it is less focused on user interfaces and more on decision making and statistical inferences. If you like statistics/math and working with data rather
                        than UI's then this might be for you. Parallel programming is more of a tool to do other things than a pursuit by itself...unless your interest is purely academic. If you want to come up with theorems for how people can compute
                        things (anything) faster using parallel computing, then dive deep on that. Otherwise, a few courses can probably get you what you need to understand the kinds of problems that parallel computing solves.

                        You could probably get some introductory level material in each area to get a good enough idea of whether or not to pursue it further. Getting a little experience in all of them is probably a good idea.
